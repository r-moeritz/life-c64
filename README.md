An implementation of [Conway's Game of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) for the Commodore 64
by JÃ¼rgen Engbring.

This program was featured in the January 1986 issue of the German Commodore 64
magazine [64'er](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/64%27er).

I have begun reassembling the source code using the information from the
magazine and the excellent [Turbo Reassembler
V2](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=97860). I hope to finish this soon. Once I'm
done and satisfied I will probably convert the source code to TMPx format for
cross-assembly.
